Final project
Team members: Jinhong Chen, Justin Eric Alvey , Patrick Micheal Garner

Project Description: Our project will use Graph data structure to implement "Trip-Planning" functionality for tourists or vacationers. From the main menu, the user can plan a trip where they would like to go. The viability of a trip (say the shortest distance) can be checked, based on the services available at each city (say stopping for gas - is there a gas station in town? If not, where do we fill up before we reach our destination.) The user can also choose to add services, if a local restaurant or hotel chain is not in the district listings. Our project is to allow users to plan an entertaining and relaxing vacation anywhere in the United States.
