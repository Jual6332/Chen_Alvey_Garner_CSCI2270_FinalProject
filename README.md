# Chen_Alvey_Garner_CSCI2270_FinalProject
final project
team members: Jinhong Chen, Justin Eric Alvey , Patrick Micheal Garner
in our project, we have different ideas, thus, we are going to write our own 
code and then combine our ideas by using different txt files to run different programs.
 First, for me , Jinhong, i'm going to write a c++ programming which can store 
data into graph structure, so , i will also create a cites graph and label the 
distance between them, then, you can select the starting place and the destination
, by using the cities graph, it can assign districts for the connected cities, 
select the distance bewteen two cites, display the paths, add the vertex.edg, find 
the shortest distance,the most intereting part is the signal part, i will assgin 
someone has a mobile or some other devices with the signls, these signls's range can 
be selected, and then, from the starting place, i will draw a circle to list the 
cities in that range, from these cities, they will be regarded as starting place 
for next step, thus, in order to reach the destination, it will select the lanes 
for that guy who has that signals ,(these signals cannot reach the signl outside that 
range circle, so only the cities in that circles can be listed) and list all of these 
paths.
